## üôã‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è About me

Hi! I'm John Bohannon, a Partner Engineer at GitHub and currently based in the Carolinas. I've been tinkering with computers since reading [Code](https://www.amazon.com/Code-Language-Computer-Hardware-Software/dp/0735611319): mostly embedded devices, APIs, and the web.

For fun, I lead a local programmers group, travel with family, read, and play instruments ü§ì üèÉ‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è üìö üé∏ üêª.
